# Dot & Box Game
The dots and boxes is a very popular game which can be played by two players. The objective of the game is to make as my boxes possible in a given grid. You can read more about this game on Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_boxes).

Although, there are many scripts available for this game but I had taken its from GitHub user [itspyguru](https://github.com/itspyguru). You can view and learn from his code on his [repository](https://github.com/itspyguru/Python-Games) and his [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpQOY-RiIk&list=PLHlrXTRZkTLCnllFO9wjnpucgFN6KrzOV).

He had developed it with his own logic and style. But in [MY VIEW](https://github.com/asadblinks), I see that his game logic had the following mentioned shortcomings:
- Ability to select game's Grid size
- When user wins a box, the turn moves to the other user rather than the user who won the box
- Ability draw/mark line with the help of mouse click
